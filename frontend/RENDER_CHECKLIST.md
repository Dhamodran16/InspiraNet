### Common Render Issues
1. **Build Timeout**: Increase timeout in service settings
2. **Memory Issues**: Optimize bundle size
3. **Environment Variables**: Check variable names and values
4. **Routing Issues**: Verify `_redirects` file
5. **CORS Errors**: Update backend CORS settings

### Debugging Steps

- Test locally with production build
- Verify environment variables
- Check browser console for errors
- Test API connectivity
